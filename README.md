# Checkpoint Dash

A 2D racing game created using the pygame library with Python. I created this game with the intention to practice and display my Python coding skills.

NOTE: To run the game, you must download both the pygame and pygame_gui libraries!

Rules of the game:

    You choose a level to play. Each level has it's own opponent.
    You choose a car to use against the opponent
    You must collect the specified number of checkpoints before the opponent does.
    Whoever reaches the specified number of collected checkpoints first wins!
    You will then have the option to replay or return to the menu screen.
